Everyone in your hometown either knows or has heard of 'Beacon Mental Hospital'.. It was supposed to be some sort of rehabilitation program for mentally insane patients who had committed some sort of hideous crime. However, only a few years after launch the entire project was scratched due to some unknown reason. Now it stands as a sort of landmark that local teenagers will occasionally dare each other to go and see.

One night, you, are strolling past the abandoned asylum when suddenly a thunder storm beings, pouring. Without much thought, you run into the hospital for shelter. Then as your curiosity grows you walk into a room labeled "Main Control Room 1F". As you shut the doors behind you, you suddenly hear the room come to life. Panicking, you try to run out of the control room, but the doors are slammed shut and locked. You take a look around and see a computer screen in front of you...

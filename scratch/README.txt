How to play: Try to make your way out of an abandoned insane asylum. You are stuck inside a control room. Manipulate the terminal and navigate through different commands such as utilizing the camera to try and solve the mystery. Ultimately, you need to escape and survive!

Technologies Used:
HTML/CSS
Javascript/Jquery

Approach taken: I used three major divs for the game. One is the main game window where images are swapped to displayed what is happening currently. The second is a log window where the player is messaged on what is happening. Finally, the last one is a textarea designed to mirror the command line in a terminal: it is by typing inside the area that the player is able to interact with the story.
